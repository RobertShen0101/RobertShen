            <h2>📜 About the game</h2>
            <h3>🗺️ Labyrinth Exploration</h3>
            <p>
                Players navigate a complex labyrinth filled with twists, turns, and hidden passages. The maze design, created using JavaScript, adds an element of strategy as players choose their path to collect keys and avoid monsters.
            </p>
            <h3>🔑 Key Collection</h3>
            <p>
                Scattered throughout the labyrinth are keys that the road runner must collect to unlock the exit door. The game's challenge lies in finding the optimal route to gather all the keys while outsmarting the monsters.
            </p>
            <h3>👾 Monsters as Obstacles</h3>
            <p>
                Cunning monsters roam the labyrinth, creating obstacles for the road runner. Players must use their skills to evade these creatures and reach the keys and the exit door without getting caught.
            </p>
            <h3>🚪 Unlocking the Exit Door</h3>
            <p>
                After collecting the required keys, players must navigate to the exit door. The game utilizes JavaScript logic to dynamically track key collection and door unlocking, providing a sense of accomplishment as players progress.
